      <br>
        <h3>🚀 Why It's Important:</h3> <br>
        <p>Version Control is the <strong>backbone of collaboration</strong> in software development. It helps teams:</p><br>
        <ul>
          <li>Track changes in code over time.</li>
          <li>Collaborate efficiently without overwriting each other's work.</li>
          <li>Revert to previous versions when needed (like undoing mistakes).</li>
          <li>Enable automation in CI/CD pipelines.</li>
        </ul>
      <br>
        <h3>📘 Key Concepts:</h3><br>

          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr><td> 🔄 Repository (Repo) </td><td> A storage location where your code and its version history are saved (like a project folder). </td></tr>
            <tr><td> 🌳 Branching </td><td> Creating a separate line of development — ideal for working on features without affecting the main code.</td></tr>
            <tr><td> ⬇️ Clone / Pull </td><td> Downloading the latest version of the code from the repository.</td></tr>
            <tr><td> ⬆️ Push </td><td> Sending your changes to the repository so others can access them.</td></tr>
            <tr><td> 🔁 Merge </td><td> Integrating changes from one branch into another.</td></tr>
            <tr><td> 💥 Conflict </td><td> When two developers change the same line of code — needs manual resolution.</td></tr>
            <tr><td> 🛠 Commit </td><td> A snapshot of your changes with a message explaining what changed.</td></tr>

      <div class="section-content">
        <br>
      
        <h3>🚀 Why They're Important:</h3>
        Cloud providers offer on-demand computing resources over the internet. They eliminate the need for physical hardware and enable scalable, flexible, and cost-effective infrastructure — a crucial part of DevOps automation.
        <br><br>
        • Easily scale applications up or down.<br>
        • Pay only for what you use.<br>
        • High availability and global distribution.<br>
        • Seamless integration with DevOps tools.<br>
        <br>
      
        <h3>📘 Key Concepts:</h3>
        🔸 IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) – Provides virtual machines, storage, and networks.<br>
        🔸 PaaS (Platform as a Service) – Offers environments for app development without managing infrastructure.<br>
        🔸 SaaS (Software as a Service) – Delivers applications over the internet (e.g., Gmail, Dropbox).<br>
        🔸 Regions & Zones – Geographic areas where cloud services are hosted.<br>
        🔸 Autoscaling – Automatically adjusts resources based on traffic/load.<br>
        🔸 Load Balancing – Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers for reliability.<br>
        <br>
      
        <h3>🔧 Popular Cloud Providers:</h3>
        • Amazon Web Services (AWS) – Most widely adopted cloud platform.<br>
        • Microsoft Azure – Strong integration with Microsoft tools.<br>
        • Google Cloud Platform (GCP) – Great for data and analytics workloads.<br>
        • IBM Cloud – Hybrid cloud and enterprise solutions.<br>
        • Oracle Cloud – Database and enterprise software focus.<br>
        • DigitalOcean – Simplified cloud for developers.<br>
        <br>
      
        <h3>🛠 Services to Know:</h3>
        • EC2, S3, Lambda (AWS)<br>
        • App Engine, Compute Engine (GCP)<br>
        • Azure Virtual Machines, Azure Functions<br>
        • Kubernetes Services (AKS, GKE, EKS)<br>
        <br>
      
        <h3>📈 Role in DevOps:</h3>
        • Infrastructure provisioning with tools like Terraform or CloudFormation.<br>
        • Hosting applications and services.<br>
        • Integrating CI/CD pipelines with cloud-hosted environments.<br>
        • Monitoring and logging cloud-based applications.<br>
        <br>
      
        <h3>✅ Must-Learn Topics in Cloud Providers:</h3>
        • Basic cloud service models: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS<br>
        • Core cloud services: Compute, Storage, Networking<br>
        • Managing resources via Web UI, CLI, and SDK<br>
        • IAM (Identity and Access Management)<br>
        • Deploying apps and scaling them in the cloud<br>

        <h2>📁 DevSecOps – Integrating Security in DevOps</h2> <br>
      <img src="../day03/Assets/DevSecOps.jpg" alt="">
      <div class="section-content">
        <br>
      
        <h3>🚀 Why It's Important:</h3>
        DevSecOps integrates security practices into the DevOps process, ensuring that security is part of the continuous integration, continuous delivery (CI/CD), and testing pipelines.
        <br><br>
        • Shifts security left, making it part of every phase of development.<br>
        • Reduces vulnerabilities by addressing security concerns early.<br>
        • Helps prevent costly security issues in production.<br>
        • Enhances collaboration between development, operations, and security teams.<br>
        <br>
      
        <h3>📘 Key Concepts:</h3>
        🔸 Shift Left – The practice of integrating security earlier in the software development lifecycle (SDLC).<br>
        🔸 Continuous Security – Using automated tools to ensure security compliance at every stage of DevOps.<br>
        🔸 Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security – Automating security policies and configurations for infrastructure.<br>
        🔸 Automated Security Testing – Running security tests automatically as part of the CI/CD pipeline.<br>
        🔸 Vulnerability Scanning – Regularly scanning code for vulnerabilities during development and testing.<br>
        🔸 Threat Modeling – Identifying potential security threats during design and early development.<br>
        <br>
      
        <h3>🔧 Tools Used in DevSecOps:</h3>
        • **Snyk** – Scans dependencies for known vulnerabilities.<br>
        • **Aqua Security** – Container security and vulnerability scanning.<br>
        • **OWASP ZAP** – Automated security testing for web applications.<br>
        • **SonarQube** – Static code analysis tool for finding bugs and security vulnerabilities.<br>
        • **HashiCorp Vault** – Secures secrets and sensitive data.<br>
        • **Fortify** – Security testing for applications and software components.<br>
        <br>
      
        <h3>🛠 Sample DevSecOps Actions:</h3>
        <code>
        # Running security tests with OWASP ZAP<br>
        zap-cli quick-scan <url><br><br>
        # Using Snyk for dependency vulnerability scanning<br>
        snyk test --all-projects<br><br>
        # Scanning containers with Aqua Security<br>
        aqua scan <image-name><br><br>
        # Running static code analysis with SonarQube<br>
        sonar-scanner<br>
        </code>
        <br><br>
      
        <h3>📈 Role in DevOps:</h3>
        • Enhances security without slowing down development processes.<br>
        • Ensures that security is an ongoing part of the development and deployment pipeline.<br>
        • Helps meet compliance standards by automating security checks.<br>
        • Promotes a security-first mindset within DevOps teams.<br>
